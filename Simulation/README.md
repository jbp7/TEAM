# Simulations

This subdirectory contains all the functions required to replicate the simulations for Figures 2 and 3 in the 
accompanying paper : Pura, Chan, Xie (2019) Multiple Testing Embedded in an Aggregation Tree to Identify
where Two Distributions Differ (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07757.pdf)

To generate Figures 2 and 3, simply source `simulation_functions.R` (this automatically sources the TEAM 
functions) and run the code in `run_simulation_figure2.R` and `run_simulation_figure3.R`. This will replicate the 
numerical experiments on each of the three settings: local shift, local dispersion, and local shift+dispersion. 

Additional details are contained in the header of each file.
