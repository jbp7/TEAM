# TEAM
Testing on the Aggregation Tree Method

The functions TEAM.R and TEAM2D.R identify local 1D and 2D regions that differ between case and control distributions.

TEAM.R takes in a vector of observations from case (x1) and control (x0). Additionally, the procedure takes in 2^K bins (default K=3) and L layers (default 3). The nominal FDR is set by alpha (default 0.05) 

The EQAPOL folder contains the code for the data analysis on 11 individuals. The case and control flow cytometry samples for each individual can be accessed https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nqlse7wiekrdlhl/AACu01RSPmIbptgwSh_cE7D1a?dl=0.
