Title: Multiple Hypothesis Testing on an Aggregation Tree Method

Description: An implementation of the TEAM algorithm to identify local differences 
    between two (e.g. case and control) independent, univariate distributions, as 
    described in J Pura, C Chan, and J Xie (2019) <arXiv:1906.07757>. The algorithm 
    is based on embedding a multiple-testing procedure on a hierarchical structure 
    to identify high-resolution differences between two distributions. The 
    hierarchical structure is designed to identify strong, short-range differences 
    at lower layers and weaker, but long-range differences at increasing layers. 
    TEAM yields consistent layer-specific and overall false discovery rate control.
